# When i select a card, it should turn up and let me see it's emoji
# to chose a second one and if it's a pair turn up another two cards.
# the pair of cards turned up should disappear from the board.
# If i fail, the cards must go back to the downside position.
# The game ends when all the pairs have been found and the boards is empty.
